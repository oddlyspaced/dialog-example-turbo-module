# React Native Turbo Module Demo

This is a small demo react native project, which was a part of my talk titled "Making React Native more Native" which I gave at the React Native Conference on 5th April, 2025 in Bangalore.

The project implements a simple user interface that accepts a message and a positive and negative label. These 3 strings are passed to a turbo native module that created and displays an Alert Dialog from the native Android/iOS side.
